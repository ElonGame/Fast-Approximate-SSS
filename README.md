An Implementation of [Approximating Translucency for a Fast, Cheap and Convincing Subsurface Scattering Look](https://colinbarrebrisebois.com/2011/03/07/gdc-2011-approximating-translucency-for-a-fast-cheap-and-convincing-subsurface-scattering-look/) which is on GDC 2011.

Only used a few vector arithmetric operations to mimic visual effects of subsurface scattering (SSS). Unity shader file is included in the project.

Example:
